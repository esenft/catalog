#  16. Summary and Reflection:
# 
#  Summarize your findings from the 
#  previous tasks, reflecting on the most 
#  significant changes in the MIT course 
#  catalog over time. Relate these changes to 
#  broader trends in education and industry.

# A compilation of findings from previous scripts can be found in the catalog_analysis_summary.pdf file.
# Overall, I have found that MIT has added many courses to the cirriculum between 1996 and 2024.
# The total course offerings more than doubled from 2,164 courses to 4,877 courses.
# Additionally, new departments were added, such as Computational and Systems Biology (CSB) and Engineering and Management (EM). 
# These changes are necessary to teach cutting-edge technologies and evolve with changes in engineering.
# Many of the courses follow similar naming conventions, but in newer courses, words like "history" and "methods" are more common, 
# which suggests that the cirriculum is focusing on foundational theories and methodologies to produce well-rounded students.
# This assignment has opened my eyes up to just how many courses are offered at MIT!
# I am curious to see how the cirriculum continues to evolve with the adoption of AI and ML.
