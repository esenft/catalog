Fundamental computational algorithms for en-

gineering and scientific applications. Weekly
programming problems cover numerical
analysis, graphics, data structures, searching,
sorting, matrix methods, and simulation. Em-
phasis on developing techniques for solving
computational problems in engineering,
science, management, and planning. Subject
taught using the C++ programming language
in the Fall term and the C programming lan-
guage in the Spring term. Some programming
background helpful, particularly for the Fall
term.

Elements of probability and statistics with em-

phasis on engineering applications. Probability
topics include univariate and multivariate dis-
tributions, estimation, and prediction; engineer-
ing reliability analysis; and Poisson and
Markov processes. Statistics include classical
and Bayesian methods of parameter estima-
tion and hypothesis testing.

sible fluid flow. Fluid properties. Hydrostatics.
Conservation of mass and momentum using
differential and integral balances. The Bernoul-
li equation. Shear stresses and velocity
profiles in laminar and turbulent flows.
Dynamic similarity. First law of ther-

ics and the energy equation. Applica-
tions to steady flow in conduits and open

1.10J Environment and Technology

(Subject meets with 10.470J, 10.570J,
TPP.52J)

Prereq.: —

U (Fall)

3-0-6

Introduction to environmental problems arising

from technologies (e.g., plas-
tics, electronics, automobiles). Considers the
sustainability of resource use and the introduc-
tion of chemicals into the environment. II-
lustrates how to predict the fates of those
chemicals in air-water-land-biota systems. Con-
siders environmental and health consequen-
ces of products and the processes used for
their manufacture. Discusses how we might
respond to undesirable impacts, including
product redesign and development of policies
to achieve environmentally sensitive improve-
ments. Meets with graduate subject 10.570J,
but assignments differ.

1.102 Transportation Laboratory

Prereq.: —

U (Spring)

0-3-3 Institute LAB

Can be repeated for credit

Laboratory experience with the properties of

rtation systems. Students formulate an
experiment based upon readings and discus-
sions of current transportation problems. Em-
phasis on formulation of hypotheses about
properties and effects of different types of
transportation systems; planning of experi-
ments and data collection in the field to test
these hypotheses, analysis of results, and
development of recommendations for changes
in transport systems plans and policies.
Consult N. H. M. Wilson.

1.105 Structural Engineering Laboratory

Prereq.: —
U (Fall)
0-3-3 Institute LAB

Introduces students to properties of structural
materials and behavior of simple structural ele-
ments and systems through a series of experi-
ments. Several laboratory projects involve the
student as both the designer and fabricator of
a structure.

1.106 Fluid Mechanics Laboratory

Prereq.: —

U (Fall)

0-2-4 Institute LAB

Credit cannot also be received for 1.108

The measurement and analysis of physical
parameters such as velocity, pressure, salinity,
temperature, dissolved solids, etc., in closed
conduits and natural water bodies. Application
of these techniques in the context of six
laboratory experiments. Certain experiments
complement lectures in 1.05, but concurrent
registration in 1.05 or previous fluid mechanics
experience is not required. (Six additional
units, satisfying the Institute Lab Requirement,
may be obtained by registering for 1.108
rather than 1.106.)
